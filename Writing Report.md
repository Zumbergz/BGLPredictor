Very superficial intro in the actual introduction. Very brief introduction to what the world of diabetes is - carb counting, pumps, cgm on a very high level.

intro into diabetes tech - into machine learning in general - into machine learning in diabetes. 

In the later chapters, refer back to the lit review as the detail is in that section. 

Dataset discussion in the introduction  - what we did to the dataset to get it into a form in which we can use.

In part 4, we can refer back to the models in part 3. Results section is going to be quite detailed as there is a lot to get across.

Future work describes how we can approach things that we investigated but didn't implement.
