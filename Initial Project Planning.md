## Objectives and Aims 
This project aims to investigate and implement methods to perform real time blood glucose prediction, then compare and contrast the benefits and drawbacks of these methods.

To guide the development of the project, the following objectives have been identified: 

- Obtain, understand and configure a suitable Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) dataset.
- Perform a literature review on existing approaches taken to perform real time blood glucose prediction.
- Implement a selection of the researched approaches.
- Experiment with hyperparameters on different approaches to try and achieve optimal accuracy for the approach as stated by scientific metrics (RMSE).
- Experiment with the different approaches over varying prediction horizons.
- Produce visualisations to view the performance of the different prediction techniques over differing time horizons.
- Analyse and compare the effectiveness of the different approaches for real time blood glucose prediction.

## Requirements
As this project is research based, there are no direct requirements for a user.
*Might fall out as research is done*

Visualisation where we can tweak things and view a time in range.

SEM1 - research and build
SEM2 - Visualise (with data endpoint) and Analyse

## Project Management
To manage the project, I have created a gantt chart outlining the steps I will take during the project's development, including any milestones I should be hitting.

## Backups
I will be performing routine backups of all report files on an external hard drive that I own, as well as using GitHub for version control of my project source code.

ng17 guidelines - used to benchmark by time in range (70% optimal)

## Performing a Lit Review
https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/learning-objects/mle/lit-review/story_content/external_files/cheat-sheet.pdf

For each paper I review, I will try to group authors by the methods they have implemented / are analysing and note their thoughts on.

As it isn't too vast, intially read paper and jot it down. Start with bullets and make a coherent structure.

Trying to achieve a  summary of work done in the area, and what I've found from that. iwht a focus on AI.
maybe a table with different approaches what theyve achieved drawbacks etc.
