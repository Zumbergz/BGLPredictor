Three different things:

1. LSTM RNN on CGM Data
	1. Test flat prediction vs change prediction
	2. Flat prediction at horizon
	3. Regressive prediction at horizon
	4. Short + Longer PH
2. Bidirectional LSTM does it improve?
3. LSTM RNN + CM - do CMs improve?
	1. Flat prediction at horizon
	2. Regressive prediction at horizon
	3. Short + Longer PH
4. Multi-Patient data - does it obtain good accuracy?
	1. Flat prediction at horizon
	2. Regressive prediction at horizon
	3. Short + Longer PH


Look into different processing techniques to achieve good results, talk about it all and contrast these three. Tikhonov regularisation.

Squared error vs PH plot.
Look into what it would take to let this loose.
Look at existing closed loop algorithm.
