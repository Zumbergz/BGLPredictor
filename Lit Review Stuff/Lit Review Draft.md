## Introduction
*Supposed to contain information about Diabetes/the background of why the research is necessary??*

Diabetes is a chronic disease that impacts people's ability to produce insulin - either partially or completely. As such, diabetics are reliant on taking external insulin in order to regulate their blood glucose levels.
Unfortunately, regulating the body's blood glucose levels is not an exact science as there are many variables that can impact a patient day to day: be it their mood, what they have eaten or any exercise they may have done. This leads to many mistakes being made in the process, which can cause potentially life-threatening situations. With an estimated 422 million people (*according to the WHO*) suffering from diabetes worldwide, it is clear that there is a need for technology to streamline and automate the regulation of blood glucose levels, saving patients' lives in the process.

The increasingly widespread introduction of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices has lead to the creation of new time-series datasets which provide a deeper view into how a patient's blood glucose level fluctuates. There has been much work done applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques to these datasets, with the goal of being able to accurately predict future blood glucose levels and produce a closed loop Artificial Pancreas (AP) system that could regulate a patient's blood glucose levels without any outside input. However, whilst there has been some success in this endeavour, most successes have been seen in *in silico* trials, where the data is produced by a diabetes software simulation program. These simulation programs fail to capture the true complexity and variability of real patient data. In reality, when using real patient data, there are still many limitations to the prediction capabilities of these models and they are seemingly unable to consider the multitude of factors which can impact a patient's blood glucose levels, and handle inaccuracies in CGM readings. 

The three most pertinent ML techniques which have been applied to the task of blood glucose prediction are Autoregressive Models (ARM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Gradient Boosting Models (GBM). All of these techniques have seen good results in short-term blood glucose prediction, and in this review we will be discussing the different approaches taken to applying these different techniques to blood glucose prediction - comparing and contrasting their relative benefits and drawbacks.
