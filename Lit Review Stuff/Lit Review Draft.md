## Introduction
*Supposed to contain information about Diabetes/the background of why the research is necessary??*

Diabetes is a chronic disease that impacts people's ability to produce insulin - either partially or completely. As such, diabetics are reliant on taking external insulin in order to regulate their blood glucose levels.

Unfortunately, regulating the body's blood glucose levels is not an exact science as there are many variables that can impact a patient day to day: be it their mood, what they have eaten or any exercise they may have done. This leads to many mistakes being made in the process, which can cause potentially life-threatening situations. With an estimated 422 million people (*according to the WHO*) suffering from diabetes worldwide, it is clear that there is a need for technology to streamline and automate the regulation of blood glucose levels, saving patients' lives in the process.

The increasingly widespread introduction of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices has lead to the existence of new time-series data pertaining ot

## Conclusion
*What can we draw from the approaches that we've seen?? How does it link to the work that I'm about to be doing in my project??*
